1,dynatrace,G2,"What do you like best about Dynatrace?
The way it automatically maps out services and dependencies is genuinely helpful, instead of guessing where an issue might be coming from, I can usually spot it pretty quickly. I also like how the dashboards pull everything together in a way that actually makes sense, even when there’s a lot of data flying around.


Another thing I appreciate is the alerts.

There’s a lot of information packed into the dashboards, and it takes a while to get comfortable with where everything is and what each view actually means

Instead of manually digging through logs or bouncing between different tools, it ties everything together and points me toward the actual root cause. That alone saves a ton of time during incidents.",mid-market
2,dynatrace,G2,"What do you like best about Dynatrace?
Honestly, Dynatrace kinda blew my mind with how simple it is to get rolling, considering the beast it is under the hood. Setup? Barely broke a sweat—super clear docs, and the UI’s not a labyrinth, which is rare for stuff this technical. I’m in there all the time, poking around because, let’s be real, it’s loaded. Full-stack monitoring, peeking at user experience, whatever—I can pretty much do it all.


Plugging it into other tools? Piece of cake. Cloud stuff, CI/CD pipelines, Slack or whatever you’re using—it just clicks together. I haven’t needed support much (thankfully), but the couple times I did, they actually answered fast and knew what they were talking about. Wild.


The real user monitoring? Total game-changer. You get to see what actual people are doing, live—not just boring stats. And session replay? It’s like CSI for user journeys. I can finally figure out what made someone rage-quit.


The metrics are super detailed, too. Response times, error rates, Apdex—so you can keep tabs on whether things are cruising or crashing. Plus, if you’re into synthetic checks, custom dashboards, or just wanna nerd out over deep-dive data from the infrastructure all the way up to the front-end, it’s all there. No joke, it’s like peeking under the hood of the whole operation.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Dynatrace?
Man, jumping into this thing? Kinda feels like being tossed into the deep end without floaties. The learning curve’s no joke, especially if you’re brand new. And don’t even get me started on the price—it’s kinda steep, honestly. Not really friendly if you’re running on a shoestring budget or if your team’s tiny. Oh, and those dashboards? They throw so much info at you, it’s like staring at a Where’s Waldo page, but with graphs. If you don’t tweak ‘em, you’ll drown in the chaos. Plus, sometimes they take forever to load. Like, go-make-a-coffee slow. Not exactly a vibe.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What problems is Dynatrace solving and how is that benefiting you?
Let me tell ya, Dynatrace is kind of a lifesaver. Seriously, it untangles so many headaches across our tech mess—it keeps tabs on basically everything. When it comes to our websites and apps, it’s like having x-ray vision: we see load times, errors, the whole user experience in real time. No more waiting for angry customer emails; we can squash problems before they blow up.


Now, session replay? Total game changer. Sometimes I swear users find new ways to break things, but with replay, we can actually watch what happened—like “oh, THAT’S why the button didn’t work.” No more wild guessing on the front-end stuff.


And then, on the infrastructure side, it doesn’t just stop at the basics. It’s got its hooks in our containers, networks, even the big enterprise machines. We get this bird’s-eye view of how everything connects and runs. Dependencies, bottlenecks, weird blips—you name it, we spot it.


The alerting and log stuff is slick too. We don’t have to bounce between a million tools to figure out what’s on fire. It just lets us know, “Hey, go fix this right now.” So yeah, everything’s in one spot, and it just makes keeping our digital world running a whole lot less stressful. If something goes sideways, we’re on it before anyone even notices.",enterprise

The Problems App is my personal favorite feature within Dynatrace, It may be very underrated but it is truly amazing and saves a lot of time when you are working on an issue. It provides a quick summary of the issue with the time when it occurred along with a link to the resources impacted so you can dig deeper. I have previously used other monitoring tools such as New Reclic or Wily Introscope but the experience with Dynatrace is so much better. Installation of the OneAgent is super easy and the navigation is very intutive. Customer support is always very resourceful and quick in their responses. We have been able to integrate Dynatrace with Cloud Foundry, GCP Compute Instances and Kubernetes very easily. In my role as a Support Engineer I use Dynatrace every day, either to monitor the Production environment using various Dashobards, triaging Production Issues using Problems App, adding and modifying Maintenance Windows to snooze alerts during Deployments.

One of feature within Dynatrace that I have challenges with is the Alerting Profiles.
