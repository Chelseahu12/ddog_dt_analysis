What I appreciate most about DataDog are its reliability and observability.

DataDog has been highly beneficial for us in many ways, from monitoring synthetic checks to tracking APM traces. The platform provides a map of interconnected, dependable services, allowing us to view latency and error rates all in one central location. The alerting mechanism is easy to use, supports numerous integrations, and consistently works smoothly.",NA
2,datadog,G2,"What do you like best about Datadog?
Datadog brings infrastructure, applications, logs, and security signals together in one place, which makes it much easier to understand what is really happening in an environment and to move quickly from detection to action. The correlation between metrics, traces, and logs is particularly valuable when diagnosing incidents, as it reduces guesswork and speeds up root cause analysis.
Review collected by and hosted on G2.com.

What do you dislike about Datadog?
While Datadog is extremely powerful, it can become difficult to control and predict costs in large or rapidly changing environments, particularly when ingesting high volumes of logs, metrics, and traces. Without strong governance and regular tuning, usage can grow quickly and lead to unexpected spend.


In addition, the breadth of features can sometimes feel overwhelming. Teams need time and clear ownership to configure dashboards, alerts, and monitors properly; otherwise, there is a risk of noise, alert fatigue, or under-utilisation of the platform’s capabilities.

What problems is Datadog solving and how is that benefiting you?
1. Lack of Unified Observability


In modern environments, teams use dozens of tools—logs, metrics, traces, synthetic monitoring, network monitors, security scanners, etc.


Datadog consolidates metrics, logs, traces, security, and real-user monitoring in one place. This helps DevOps, SRE, security, and business teams collaborate with a single source of truth.


2. Troubleshooting is Hard and Slow


Distributed systems mean a single user action might trigger dozens of services.


Datadog provides distributed tracing, log correlation, and visualizations that allow you to trace requests end-to-end and pinpoint slow or broken parts of the system fast.


3. Cloud Complexity


Cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) change constantly—instances spin up/down, containers come and go, etc.


Datadog offers real-time monitoring and auto-discovery to keep up with these ephemeral environments.


4. Siloed Teams & Tools


Dev, Ops, Security, and Business teams often use different tools and speak different ""languages"".


Datadog’s platform allows shared dashboards, alerts, and insights, helping teams align on problems and priorities.


5. Proactive Monitoring Instead of Reactive Firefighting


Teams often only react after customers are impacted.",mid-market

Datadog is very easy to use and provides a unified platform for monitoring, metrics, logs, and traces.

User management is straightforward, and setting up monitors is quick and reliable. Integration is also straightforward, in our case, we use it with Microsoft Teams and Azure without any issues. Their customer support has always been responsive and helpful whenever we’ve needed assistance.

Datadog provides a unified observability platform that’s incredibly easy to integrate across our stack.

While Datadog is powerful, the pricing can become difficult to manage as usage scales—especially with high-cardinality metrics or large log volumes.

At Sigma, Datadog helps us centralize observability across our microservices and data infrastructure, making it easier to monitor system health, trace performance bottlenecks, and proactively catch issues before they impact customers.

Security should be contained within one page, rather than broken out into multiple SKUs -- for example, if there is a log detection trigger, I should be able to see the information from Workload Security, CSPM, etc. about the host in question in the same pane.

1 months into datadog, my decision of choosing Datadog over Grafana is already biting me. None of my expectations were materialized

1. Datadog was not quicker to set up; there are less support docs/examples comparing to Grafana.

2. Datadog's support team are all about being ""nice"" instead of making real progress. Very inefficient.

3. When you are stuck, their support will remind you of the ""switching cost"" instead of solving real problems for you. Very distasteful.
